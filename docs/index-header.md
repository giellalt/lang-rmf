There are several Romani languages, and it is at the moment not clear how many standardised Romani languages there are in the Nordic countries. [Here is an overview](../../lang-rmy/docs/romani-languages.html).

This page documents the work on the [Kalo Finnish Romani language model](https://github.com/giellalt/lang-rmf). Some work has been done, based upon Kimmo Granqvist's *Lyhyt Suomen romanikielen kielioppi* (2011).
